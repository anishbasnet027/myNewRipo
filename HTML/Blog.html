We use different technologies in our daily life we use technicals for transportation, the internet or phones to communicate, high technology devices are used to cure in hospitals, the internet for education person and many more. There are many positive as well as the negative impact of technology on humans and society.</p><br>

				<h2 style="text-align: left; ">Positive impacts</h2><br>

Technology has reduced the problems of farmers and can grow many crops in a short time, reducing the diseases and insects in plants and even desert places can grow crops.

People can save time and money using the internet. Many employees who work on google are self-educated.Human can not live alone in society they need support and help from parents, friends or others and to keep in touch with everyone people can we social networks like facebook, instagram, skype etc to keep in touch.

				<p>manufacture products, use to manage employees and customers, to competitive opponents, to increase production and in many ways to satisfy the customer and stay in profit. Many big companies use and develop advanced technology systems like tesla, SpaceX, blue origin etc. People should not read a newspaper or watch tv in a specific time to know the news in the world or to get entertained. People can see on their smartphone, laptops or tv youtube. youtube, google, Netflix, amazon prime etc are the source of entertainment and news in the world.</p> 
				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Negative impacts</h2><br>
				<p> Technology has made our lives easier but it has also made us lazy and unhealthy. Everything is available on the internet and mobile phone so we don't walk or move to things like before. Kids and youths are addicted to video games rather than playing outdoor games which results in vision problems, hearing problems, neck problems etc. There are many people with the wrong intention to harm other privacy by hacking social media account or bank account which results in damage to the victim. Too much involvement in technology results in deficits in Social Skills. The Internet teaches us everything, there are some ways to access the crime sites where many illegal activities happen like torturing people in the red room, hackers, drug selling, hiring hitman etc. </p> <br>
				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Conclusion</h2><br>

				<p>Technology has helped us in our daily lives and each day technology is getting more advanced we should adapt to the new technologies and use them in our daily life for a good purpose. Though technology is built to make human life easier, some people with bad intentions may build to harm others we should stay away from them. We should always practice a healthy life, too much involvement in computers or internet may end up physical, mental and social problems.</p><br>
